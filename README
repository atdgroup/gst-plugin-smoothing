Image Smoothing plugin
======================

What it is
----------

This is a filter element for GStreamer 1.0 for applying some smoothing (low pass filtering) to the image. It uses a Gaussian kernel and you are able to set the kernelsize (e.g. 3x3 pixels) and Gaussain sigma. 

Comments
--------

 - Includes ability to apply smoothing on the linear intensity scale even if the vidoe feed has gamma applied. See src/gstsmoothingfilter.h for the GAMMA factor. Set this to 1 (one) to disable this feature.

Building
--------

Building on linux is tested using the autogen script.

First run autogen.sh
	$ chmod a+x autogen.sh
	$ ./autogen.sh
This will use autotools to setup the dev environment, and complete with the line:
"Now type 'make' to compile this module."
You can do that.
	$ make

	$ sudo make install 
will put install the lo file for use with GStreamer, in /usr/local/lib/gstreamer-1.0
To use this in a pipeline you need to tell gstreamer where to find the .lo file.
use:
	$ export GST_PLUGIN_PATH=/usr/local/lib/gstreamer-1.0

See the INSTALL file for advanced setup.

To import into the Eclipse IDE, use "existing code as Makefile project", and the file EclipseSymbolsAndIncludePaths.xml is included here
to import the library locations into the project (Properties -> C/C++ General -> Paths and symbols).
